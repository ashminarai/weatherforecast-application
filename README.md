**ðŸš€ Simple weather forecast app using reactJs (Note: This application only showcase the temperature of places.) ðŸš€**

(Note: I have changed the api key that I used in the code because it was sensitive.)

**1. Requirements**

-ReactJS

**2. Website link for API call**
https://openweathermap.org/

(Note: you should create an account to obtain the access for API call and change the api according to it as it varies.)

**Further introduction**

**3. Run the code using npm start**

**4. After, running the code you can see a proper GUI as shown below. (I set Dharan as a default place.)**
